# Order Management with REST API

A simple REST order management system using Springboot, JPA, H2 database. This is from the perspective of the staff that manages the orders, not from a customer view.
You can add menu items to the database and create orders based on these items.  
With orders you can: 
- Create
- Get single order or all of them
- Update complete status
- Delete order by id or delete completed orders

You can reach the service on
